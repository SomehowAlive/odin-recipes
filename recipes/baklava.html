      Damn Look at this beautiful geometric delicious looking tasty pastry that
      my grandma can make without having studied geometry and believe me when
      you try it you'll eat your hands after it lol. <br />
      Baklawa is oan Ottoman patrimony that Algerians prepare for festive
      occasions. The tasty pastry is made up of almonds, filled with chopped
      walnuts and natural honey. <br />
      Now although Baklawa is a very tasty pastry that foreigners fall in love
      with; try not to each too much since each Baklawa has 230 calories, and
      you might end up eating 10 if you try the first one.
